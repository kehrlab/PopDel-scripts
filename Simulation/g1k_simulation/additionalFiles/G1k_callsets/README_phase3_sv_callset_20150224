This README describes the integrated structural variant map of the 1000 Genomes Project phase3 data.

The directory contains the final structural variant call set with phased genotypes for chr1-22 and chrX, 
derived from the analysis of the phase3 sequencing data linked in the below sequence and alignment index files.

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/sequence_indices/20130502.analysis.sequence.index
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/alignment_indices/20130502.low_coverage.alignment.index

This variant set contains 2504 individuals from 26 populations. The list of all the samples in the data set and 
their population, super population and gender can be found in the file:

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel

Different structural variant callers were used to identify the variant sites in this set. The input call sets can be found at

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/input_callsets

Large deletions were genotyped using Beagle and phased with the Shapeit2 method from Oxford. MVNCall, also from Oxford was used to 
add other structural variant classes. The genotype likelihoods estimated by Shapeit2 and MVNCall can be found at 

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/genotype_likelihoods

The different structural variant classes can be identified using the SVTYPE tag in the INFO column. Below is a list of possible SVTYPEs:

ALU: Alu element insertion
LINE1: Line1 transposable element insertion
SVA: SVA element insertion, SVA stands for SINE-VNTR-Alu, it is a composite retrotransposon insertion
INS: Nuclear mitochondrial insertion
DEL: bi-allelic deletion
DUP: bi-allelic duplication
INV: bi-allelic inversion
CNV: multi-allelic copy-number variant

The DEL class has been further re-classified into DEL_ALU, DEL_LINE1 and DEL_SVA if the identified deletion appeared to 
correspond to a reference mobile element insertion.

The source call set can be identified using the CS tag in the INFO column. Below is a list of possible CSs:

ALU_umary: Alu element insertion call set from the University of Maryland (MELT algorithm)
L1_umary: Line1 transposable element insertion from the University of Maryland (MELT algorithm)
SVA_umary: SVA element insertion from the University of Maryland (MELT algorithm)
NUMT_umich: Nuclear mitochondrial insertion from the University of Michigan (NumtS algorithm)
DEL_union: Union deletions genotypted by GenomeSTRiP and variant sites identified by GenomeSTRiP, Breakdancer, CNVnator, Delly and Variation Hunter.
DEL_pindel: Small deletions (<1kbp) from Washington University (Pindel algorithm)
INV_delly: Bi-allelic simple inversions from EMBL (Delly algorithm)
CINV_delly: Bi-allelic complex inversions from EMBL (Delly algorithm)
DUP_gs: Bi-allelic duplications and copy-number variants from Broad Institute (GenomeSTRiP algorithm)
DUP_delly: Bi-allelic tandem duplications from EMBL (Delly algorithm)
DUP_uwash: Bi-allelic deletions, duplications and copy-number variants from University of Washington (SSF algorithm)

Most SVs are part of the 1000GP marker paper, except for DEL_pindel and CINV_delly. 
A complete list of the differences between the marker paper and the SV paper can be found here:
ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/supporting/SVs_missing_from_main_release/

Since different structural variant callers have been used in the project a large number of variant sites have been merged in the final release. 
For a merged call the collapsed variant site IDs are listed in the MC tag in the INFO column.

Besides the integrated SV map, this directory also contains a call set with phased genotypes of complex deletions identified by Pindel where 
NA12878 was required to be a carrier for validation purposes:

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/integrated_sv_map/ALL.autosomes.pindel.20130502.complexindex.low_coverage.genotypes.vcf.gz 

The supporting sub-directory contains the following resources:

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/integrated_sv_map/supporting

./CHM1: CHM1 illumina and PacBio sequencing data used for validation purposes
./NA12878: NA12878 Illumina and PacBio sequencing data used for validation purposes
./acgh: aCGH data used for validation purposes
./breakpoints: Breakpoint resolved SVs, most of which have been assembled by TIGRA-SV and were subsequently analysed using AGE and CROSSMATCH
./irs_matrices: Intensity matrices used in the IRS test for bi-allelic deletions, duplications and copy-number variants

Here are some basic statistics about the structural variant call set.

samples: 2504

All male genotypes are unknown on chrX for the union deletions
 because the genotype encoding was not picked up correctly by the phasing
 software. Please refer to the unphased union deletion genotypes for chrX
 where 0/1 encodes copy-number 1 and 1/1 encodes copy-number 0. The unphased
 union deletions are available here:
